# Python_Projects

**NOTE:** this is an old version of the project that will no longer be updated. The GUI program is missing many features and lacks any exception handling, and might have problems closing the maze GUI after exploration. For the most recent version of the projects, go to *main* branch or check out the other versions if you are only interested one of the projects.

This project contains multiple stand-alone Python projects written by Ishaan Bose.

## Contents
1. **astar.py** - a Python program that implements the A* path finding algorithm using a .txt file with a text-based maze.
2. **astar_GUI.py** - a Python program that implements the A* path finding algorithm with help of a GUI.

Any specific information required to execute the files will be given in the documentation of the respective Python project.
